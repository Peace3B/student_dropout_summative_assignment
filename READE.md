# Higher Education Student Performance Prediction System Pipe Line

## Overview
This project develops a machine learning pipeline to predict student dropout rates in higher education. Using historical student data—like grades, study time, and past failures—it aims to identify students at risk of dropping out, empowering schools to offer timely support and boost retention.

- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI (Swagger UI)

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)
- Git

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone 
cd ml_
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Unix or MacOS:
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

### Running the Application

1. Start the FastAPI server:
```bash
uvicorn src.api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

2. Access the following endpoints:
- API Documentation: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- Web Interface: `http://localhost:8000`

### Running with Docker
1. Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t student_dropout .
```

2. Run the container:
```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 student_dropout
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

## Model Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- ROC-AUC
- Confusion Matrix

## Load Testing with Locust
I conducted load testing on my model's `/api/predict` endpoint using Locust to evaluate its performance under stress. The test simulated 30 concurrent users sending requests to a single Docker container deployment.

### Running Locust Tests
To run the load tests locally:
```bash
locust -f locust_latency.py --host=https://student-drop-out.onrender.com/
```


#### Detailed Observations

##### Latency and Response Times
![Locust Test Results](latency.png)
*Figure 1: Response time distribution and RPS over time*

##### Performance Metrics
![Locust Performance Metrics](response.png)
*Figure 2: Detailed performance statistics from load testing*

This chart shows response times (in milliseconds) over time for a system under load testing.

Two key percentiles are tracked:

50th percentile (median) → (orange) Represents the typical response time for half of the requests.

95th percentile → (purple) Indicates the upper range where most (95%) of responses fall under.

Observations:

Initially, response times were low and stable (~11ms for the 50th percentile).

Over time, response times gradually increased, indicating performance degradation as load increased.

Around 2:20 PM, there was a spike, suggesting a potential bottleneck or increased load affecting response times.
